#Triangulation Simulator

Hello, just for fun I programmed a Triangulation Simulator. I've tested it only on my Mac, so if there are any Problems be free to improve for Windows or so. This calculator is written for Python 3.x. Secondly you need PyGame to start this. After starting the terminal will ask you for a room size of your test field. You must know that 1 'meter' will be presented with 100 pixels. After that you see a room (from top) with two senders. The red robot can measure the angle between the horizontal line (red) and the sender (green). After that it can calculate the koordinates of himself. There is a blue spinning circle around the left sender. This circle marks, that you can edit the angle measured with this sender by pressing key up and key down. When you press tab you can edit the other sender. The distance between the sender is the entered room width minus 0.5m. The robot koordinates will be displayed in cm. The origin (0|0) is the left ssender. I hope you enjoy my little program I have wrote with 14 years.
